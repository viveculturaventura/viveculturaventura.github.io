&lt;p&gt;Today, the mixture between the traditional cooking and the more experimental can be found in several places, but we should not forget the daily basis, and the traditional &amp;ldquo;Pinchos&amp;rdquo;, the special Spanish Tapas from this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say you should visit the wineries, cider houses, traditional olive oil factories, bakeries, dairies, traditional cheese factories, etc, to really see from where we obtain our best food&lt;/p&gt;
